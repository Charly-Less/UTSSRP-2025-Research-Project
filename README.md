# UTSSRP 2025 Research Project

The UofT Summer Statistical Research Program invited 24 selected undergraduate students to expose them to their graduate program, as well as providing them with an innovative experience. For my project, I had the opportunity to work with Professor Leonard Wong, and my task was to compare the rate of convergence of two different estimators: The Wasserstein density estimator and the maximum likelihood estimator.

This repository includes the code implementation of both these estimators. The Jupyter notebook shows step-by-step how the Wassersein estimator was implemented. The R Markdown file shows step-by-step how the MLE estimator was implemented, as well as the comparison of the rate of convergence of both estimators for a given data sample.
